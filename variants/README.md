# Discovery and analysis of TeNT variants

This subdirectory contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the variant analysis in Hodgkins et al.

To run it, you will need a Linux-based operating system with `python` and either `singularity` or `docker` installed. `python` is needed for some processing scripts, while `singularity`/`docker` are used to virtualize other bits of software in reproducible containers.

You will also need to download the `read_alignments.tar.gz` archive, which is available at the following link:
