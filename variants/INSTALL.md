To use these scripts, you will need the Singularity containerization software:
- [singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html)

Your system will also need `python` and a few other programs that will be included with any basic Linux installation.

When you have Singularity installed, use `./scripts/setup.sh` to initialize the work environment. This will pull the appropriate images.
