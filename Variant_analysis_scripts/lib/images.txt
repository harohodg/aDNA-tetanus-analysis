# Mike Mansfield, 2021
# This file contains a list of biocontainer images used in these scripts.
# The structure of this file allows software names to be tied to specific,
# version-controlled containers. The container images originate from bioconda,
# which get converted to containers by biocontainers, which are in turn
# hosted on quay.io.
#
# These images are used to run the software used in these scripts, and
# are provided to ease reproducibility.
#
# To reproduce the variant analysis, singularity installed
# and available on the PATH.
#
# Note that you have to pull one of my images for Octopus. At the time of writing,
# the authors' recipes for the dev and master branches on GitHub were broken.
